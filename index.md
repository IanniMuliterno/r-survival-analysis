*An introduction to survival analysis in R using Game of Thrones mortality dataset.*

The goal of this lesson is to practice the common methods for data manipulation and visualisation. These materials are based on the mortality dataset of the *Games of Thrones* television series, which was published in *[Injury Epidemiology][article]*.

Note that this lesson will focus on teaching the best practices using **base R** and **ggplot2** and **dplyr** packages. Methods for statistical analysis here are not taught in depth. This lesson should preferably be given at the end of a two-day introductory R workshop (e.g. [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis][reproducible-analysis] or [Programming with R][r-programming]).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Familiarity with the **ggplot2** and **dplyr** packages and **base R** functions for data frame manipulations and plotting.
